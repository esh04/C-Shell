# C-Shell

- To run the shell
    - `make`
    - `./a.out`

- Assumptions
    - `discover` does not print the hidden files and directories. To include hidden files and directories too follow instructions mentioned in `discover.c`
    - While giving multiple file inputs to `ls`, the directories/files are not sorted alphabetically but their results are.
